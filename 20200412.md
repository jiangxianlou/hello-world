# Coffee

Globally, over 2 billion cups of coffee are consumed every day.

In Britain alone, we need around 95 million cups to keep us going from dawn 'til dusk.
仅在英国，我们需要大约9500万杯咖啡才能然我们从黎明一直持续到黄昏。

but 450 years ago, Western Europe had barely even heard of it. Coffee's roots lie in Ethiopia, where the wild palnt grew.
